  The Natural Thai Network connects students with expert Thai teachers.

  We promote natural Thai learning approaches, known as "comprehensible input", and our partners are inspired by such figures as Dr Stephen Krashen, Dr James Marvin Brown, Dr Adrian 'Buzz' Palmer, Kristian Peltonen, Pablo Pankun Rom√°n, and many others.
