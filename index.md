  headline: Why Learn Thai Naturally?
  content: "<p>Over the centuries, many students have tried to learn Thai by writing
    out thousands of flashcards, drilling tones (while moving their heads or hands),
    and repeating mysterious sentences after their teachers and friends.<br><br>But
    we're here to tell you, there's a better way. You can learn Thai naturally!</p><p>Through
    extensive exposure to fun and engaging lessons, students can naturally pick up
    the Thai language and even learn about Thai culture.</p><p>How does it work? Our
    expert Thai teaching partners use level-appropriate Thai to tell fun stories,
    to demonstrate real life Thai experiences, and to invite students into discussions
    and scenarios.</p><p>Through these experiences, you will find that your mind naturally
    understands through context and begins to put the pieces of the language together.
    This is without drills, without flashcards, and without grammar lectures.</p><p>Are
    you ready to give it a try?</p>"
